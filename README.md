<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>

### What is memcp?
memcp is an open-source, high-performance, columnar in-memory database that can handle both OLAP and OLTP workloads. It provides an alternative to proprietary analytical databases and aims to bring the benefits of columnar storage to the open-source world.

###
memcp is written in Golang and is designed to be portable and extensible, allowing developers to embed the database into their applications with ease. It is also designed with a focus on scalability and performance, making it a suitable choice for distributed applications.

### Features
- Columnar storage: Stores data column-wise instead of row-wise, which allows for better compression, faster query execution, and more efficient use of memory.
- In-memory database: Stores all data in memory, which allows for extremely fast query execution.
- Build fast REST APIs directly in the database (they are faster because there is no network connection / SQL layer in between)
- Compression is 1:5 (80% memory saving) compared to MySQL/MariaDB
- OLAP and OLTP support: Can handle both online analytical processing (OLAP) and online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads.
- Bit-packing and dictionary encoding: Uses bit-packing and dictionary encoding to achieve higher compression ratios for integer and string data types, respectively.
- Delta storage: Maintains separate delta storage for updates and deletes, which allows for more efficient handling of OLTP workloads.
- Scalability: Designed to scale on a single node with huge NUMA memory
- Adjustable persistency: Decide whether you want to persist a table or not or to just keep snapshots of a period of time

<h1 align="center">Getting Started üö∂</h1>

Compile the project with

```
make
```

Run the engine with

```
./memcp
```

connect to it via

```
mysql -u root -p -P 3307 # password is 'admin'
```

You can try queries like:
```sql
SHOW DATABASES
SHOW TABLES
CREATE TABLE foo(bar string, amount int)
INSERT INTO foo(bar, amount) VALUES ('Man', 4), ('Horse', 6)
SELECT * FROM foo
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM foo
```

<h1 align="center">Example REST API App üìï</h1>

```
./memcp apps/bayesian.scm
```

now you can use the Bayesian classifier under http://localhost:4321/bayes/ as a REST service

<h1 align="center">How it Works? ‚ùì</h1>

- MemCP supports multiple databases that can have multiple tables
- Every table has multiple columns and multiple data shards
- Every data shard has ~64,000 items and is meant to be processed in ~100ms
- Parallelization is done over shards
- Every shard consists of two parts: main storage and delta storage
- main storage is column-based, fixed-size and is compressed
- Delta storage is a list of row-based insertions and deletions that is overlaid over a main storage
- (rebuild) will merge all main+delta storages into new compressed main storages with empty delta storages
- every dataset has a shard-local so-called recorded


<h1 align="center">Available column compression formats üìÉ</h1>

- uncompressed
- bit-size reduced integer storage with offset
- integer sequences (based on 3x integer storage)
- string-storage
- string-dictionary (based on integers)
- float storage
- sparse storage (efficient with lots of NULL values)
- prefix storage (optimizes strings that start with the same substring over and over)

<h1 align="center">Frequently Asked Questions ü§î</h1>

### What is an in-memory database?
Unlike traditional databases, which store data on disks, in-memory databases (IMDBs) keep data in RAM. This results in much faster access times.

### Why it is used?
An in-memory database (IMDB) stores and retrieves data primarily in a computer's RAM, enabling exceptionally fast data processing and retrieval, making it suitable for real-time applications requiring rapid access to data.

### Can in-memory databases be used in distributed or cloud environments?
Yes, many in-memory databases are designed to work in distributed and cloud environments, offering scalability and fault tolerance. However, their configuration and deployment may vary depending on the specific database system.
