package storage

/*

JSON storage on disk for persistence:
 - each node has its own data folder
 - each db/table.jsonl is a jsonl file
 - the first line is #table so it can be read by a simple .jsonl
 - a line can also say #delete <recordid>
 - a line can also say #update <recordid> json
 - on rewrite, db/_table.jsonl is rebuild and replaced (maybe once a week)
